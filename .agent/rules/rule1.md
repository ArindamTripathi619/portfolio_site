You’re thinking in the **right direction** already — the fact that you’re aiming for an *Apple-level narrative portfolio* (not a generic “projects + skills” site) is exactly how you stand out from the clout.

I’ll break this into **clear layers** so you can execute it systematically using **Gemini Nano Banana, Google Labs Flow, and Google Stitch**, while aligning it *specifically to you* (AI + Flutter + systems + research mindset).

---

## 1️⃣ Your Portfolio’s CORE POSITIONING (Most Important)

Before visuals, decide **what story your portfolio tells in 5 seconds**.

### Your Unique Angle (based on what I know about you)

You are not just:

* ❌ “A web dev”
* ❌ “A Flutter developer”
* ❌ “An AI enthusiast”

You **are**:

> **A systems-minded engineer who blends AI, design, and engineering to build emotionally engaging + technically solid products**

This must reflect in:

* Motion
* Copy
* Structure
* Transitions

Think:

> *Apple-style storytelling + research depth + indie-hacker polish*

## 2️⃣ Visual Inspiration Direction (What to Emulate)

### What you’re borrowing (NOT copying):

* Scroll-driven storytelling
* Large typography
* Sparse color palette
* Micro-animations that feel *inevitable*, not flashy
* Cinematic framing (video-as-background, not video players)

---

## 3️⃣ INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (Apple-style Narrative)

### ❌ Typical Portfolio Structure (DON’T do this)

* Hero
* About
* Skills
* Projects
* Contact

### ✅ Your Structure (Story-first)

```
[01] Opening Statement (Identity)
[02] What I Build (Domains)
[03] Signature Projects (Narrative Case Studies)
[04] How I Think (Systems + Research)
[05] Tools & Stack (Subtle)
[06] Proof of Depth (Experiments, Blogs, GitHub)
[07] Human Ending (Personal Note)
```

---

## 4️⃣ SECTION-BY-SECTION DESIGN PLAN

---

### 🔥 SECTION 1: Cinematic Hero (Above the Fold)

![Image](https://cdn.dribbble.com/userupload/14615260/file/original-8b2c793b56df840b1fdae83c4011517f.png?format=webp\&resize=400x300\&vertical=center)

**Visual**

* Full viewport
* Dark background (deep graphite / midnight blue)
* Subtle animated noise or gradient
* Video-like loop (frames rendered via Gemini)

**Text (Minimal)**

```
I build intelligent systems
that feel human.
```

Secondary line (fades in):

```
AI • Flutter • Systems • Research
```

**Animation**

* Text fades in *after* background motion begins
* Cursor scroll hint appears only after 2s

---

### 🧠 SECTION 2: What You Build (Domains)

Use **horizontal scroll on vertical scroll** (Apple trick).

![Image](https://htmlburger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/horizontal-scrolling-website-examples.png)

![Image](https://assets.aceternity.com/cloudinary_bkp/Hero_Scroll_xzhqrj.png)

![Image](https://simpleswiftguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/01-Horizontal-Scroll-View-SwiftUI.png)

Each “card”:

* AI Systems
* Mobile Experiences
* Research & Experiments
* Emotional UX

**Each card contains**

* One short cinematic animation
* 1 sentence only

Example:

> *“I turn abstract intelligence into usable systems.”*

---

### 🚀 SECTION 3: Signature Projects (Case Study Style)

![Image](https://uploads.toptal.io/blog/image/129786/toptal-blog-image-1558975129584-d32c669127ffbb2c31f08a7315747382.jpg)

![Image](https://supply.family/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MM-09-main1-1465x980.jpg)

Do **ONLY 3–4 projects**, deeply.

Each project:

* Full-width section
* Background animation (generated frames)
* Sticky text while visuals scroll

**Structure**

1. Problem
2. Insight
3. Solution
4. Outcome
5. Tech (last, small)

This fits **your AI calculator, Krishna chatbot, Flutter app**, etc.

---

### 🔬 SECTION 4: How You Think (This Is Your Differentiator)

This section proves you’re not just building — you’re **thinking**.

Include:

* Architecture diagrams (animated)
* Research notes
* Experiment logs
* Failures & learnings

This screams **future researcher / deep engineer**.

---

### 🧰 SECTION 5: Tools (Minimal, Almost Hidden)

Apple-style rule:

> *If you’re good, don’t shout your tools.*

Use:

* Monochrome icons
* On hover → subtle glow
* No percentages, no bars

---

### 🧍 SECTION 6: Human Ending

![Image](https://colorlib.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/dovile-about-me-page.jpg)

![Image](https://cdn.dribbble.com/userupload/13678196/file/original-1ab0a35fa172f4bf808ef3f9591a0802.jpg?resize=752x\&vertical=center)

One paragraph.
No resume tone.

Example:

> “I enjoy building things that sit quietly until they matter. When I’m not coding, I think about systems, philosophy, and how technology shapes emotion.”

---

## 5️⃣ HOW TO GENERATE ASSETS (Your Toolchain)

### 🧠 Gemini Nano Banana

Use for:

* Cinematic background frames
* Abstract motion concepts
* Product metaphors

**Prompt pattern**

```
Create cinematic abstract motion frames for a tech portfolio.
Style: Apple product reveal
Lighting: soft, moody
Color: deep blue, silver highlights
No text, no logos
```

Export:

* Image sequences (PNG/WebP)
* 24–30 frames per loop

---

### 🌀 Google Labs Flow

Use for:

* Motion continuity
* Scroll-tied animation logic
* Narrative pacing

Think:

> “When should this *feel* heavy vs light?”

---

### 🧵 Google Stitch

Use for:

* Micro-interactions
* UI texture continuity
* Button hover physics
* Transition easing

Avoid:

* Bouncy
* Over-elastic
* Neon effects

---

## 6️⃣ TECH STACK RECOMMENDATION (Important)

**Frontend**

* Next.js + App Router
* Framer Motion
* GSAP (ScrollTrigger)
* Lenis (smooth scroll)

**Media**

* WebP sequences
* MP4 fallback
* `prefers-reduced-motion` support

**Performance**

* Lazy-load frames
* IntersectionObserver
* Device-based asset resolution

---

## 7️⃣ EXECUTION ORDER (DO THIS STEP-BY-STEP)

### Phase 1 – Strategy (1–2 days)

* Write site narrative
* Choose 3 projects only
* Define motion mood

### Phase 2 – Asset Generation (3–5 days)

* Generate all backgrounds first
* Export frame sequences
* Compress aggressively

### Phase 3 – Motion System (3–4 days)

* Implement scroll logic
* Timing before visuals

### Phase 4 – Polish (2–3 days)

* Typography spacing
* Color temperature
* Motion easing

---

## 8️⃣ FINAL ADVICE (Very Important)

> **Standing out today is not about showing more.
> It’s about showing restraint with confidence.**
