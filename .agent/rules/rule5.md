Perfect. We’ll do this in **two tightly connected parts**:

1️⃣ **A moodboard in words + visual references** (to align your intuition)
2️⃣ **A locked asset style guide** (so every generated asset obeys the same visual DNA)

Think of this as your **portfolio’s constitution**.

---

# PART 1 — MOODBOARD (IN WORDS + REFERENCES)

## 🧠 THE CORE MOOD (RESTATE, BUT RICHER)

> **Quiet intelligence, revealed slowly, through light, depth, and restraint.**

Your portfolio should feel like:

* Entering a **dimly lit research space**
* Where ideas float into clarity
* Where nothing asks for attention — but everything *earns* it

---

## 🎞️ CINEMATIC REFERENCES (MENTAL MODELS)

These are not to be copied — they define *tone*.

### 🎥 Film / Visual Tone

* *Arrival* (2016) — calm, intellectual mystery
* *Ex Machina* — minimal, controlled futurism
* Apple product launch films — inevitability, not hype
* Studio Ghibli night scenes — quiet presence

### 🖥️ Web / Product References

What you’re extracting:

* Scroll as narrative
* One idea per viewport
* Soft darkness
* Large typography + silence

---

## 🎨 COLOR MOODBOARD (DESCRIBED)

Picture this palette **without seeing hex codes**:

* Background: deep midnight blue, like the sky just before complete darkness
* Foreground light: brushed silver catching soft light
* Text: warm off-white, like paper under a desk lamp
* Accent: a *single* restrained glow (cyan / amber / violet)

Nothing shouts. Everything **breathes**.

---

## 💡 LIGHT & MATERIAL MOOD

Imagine:

* Frosted glass
* Matte metal
* Diffused LEDs
* Light passing *through* objects, not bouncing off them

Your visuals should feel **physically lit**, even when abstract.

---

## 🌊 MOTION MOOD

Motion behaves like:

* Smoke in slow air
* Light through water
* A thought forming

No excitement.
Only emergence.

---

## 🧍 HUMAN MOOD

If a visitor anthropomorphizes your site, it is:

* Calm
* Observant
* Slightly distant
* Extremely competent

It does not try to impress.
It lets the viewer discover.

---

## 🔒 MOODBOARD SUMMARY (SAVE THIS)

> **Dark, cinematic, light-driven, patient, intellectual, restrained, human.**

If something feels:

* Flashy → remove
* Playful → soften
* Loud → slow down

---

# PART 2 — LOCKED ASSET STYLE GUIDE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This is what you will **actually enforce** when generating assets with
Gemini Nano Banana, Google Labs Flow, and Google Stitch.

---

## 🎬 ASSET CATEGORIES (ONLY THESE EXIST)

You are allowed to create assets only in these buckets:

1. Hero cinematic loop
2. Section ambient loops
3. Project concept visuals
4. System / flow visuals
5. Micro-motion elements
6. Static textures (rare)

Anything else = scope creep.

---

## 🖼️ FRAME COMPOSITION RULES

### Camera

* Always slow-moving or static
* No sudden direction changes
* No zoom beyond 1.05×

### Framing

* Center-weighted
* Large negative space
* Subject never touches edges

### Perspective

* Slight depth
* No extreme angles
* Eye-level or slightly elevated

---

## 💡 LIGHTING RULES (CRITICAL)

Every asset must obey:

* One dominant light source
* Soft falloff
* Subtle bloom on highlights
* Shadows are *never* pure black

When prompting AI:

> Always describe **light first**, then shape.

---

## 🎨 COLOR RULES

* Max 2 colors per frame (background + highlight)
* Saturation always low
* Contrast always soft

🚫 No neon
🚫 No multicolor gradients
🚫 No pure black / white

---

## 🧱 SHAPE & FORM RULES

Allowed:

* Smooth planes
* Soft curves
* Long lines
* Abstract volumes

Forbidden:

* Icons
* Symbols
* Text
* UI mockups floating in space
* Hard geometry

---

## 🎞️ MOTION RULES

### Duration

* Loops: 4–8 seconds
* Micro motions: 300–600ms

### Motion types (ONLY THESE):

* Drift
* Fade
* Reveal
* Align
* Emerge

🚫 No bounce
🚫 No elastic
🚫 No pulse

---

## 🧬 TEXTURE RULES

* One subtle noise layer max
* Grain only visible if you *look for it*
* Never patterned

Texture is there to prevent sterility — not to decorate.

---

## 🧠 PROJECT VISUALS (SPECIAL RULE)

For every project:

* 1 **conceptual visual** (idea)
* 1 **system visual** (thinking)

Never:

* Raw screenshots
* Code blocks
* Screen recordings

Your projects are **ideas first**, implementations second.

---

## 🧾 GEMINI PROMPT TEMPLATE (LOCKED)

Use this structure **every time**:

```
Cinematic abstract motion frames.
Mood: quiet, intellectual, restrained
Lighting: soft, directional, volumetric
Color palette: dark blue-black, muted highlights
Motion: slow emergence, gentle drift
Style: Apple product reveal, research film aesthetic
No text, no symbols, no logos, no UI
```

Only change:

* Shape metaphor
* Emotional emphasis

---

## 🔐 FINAL ASSET STYLE LOCK (SAVE THIS)

> **All assets must feel like they belong to the same quiet, intelligent world — lit by thought, shaped by patience, and animated by intention.**

If an asset:

* Draws attention to itself → reject it
* Explains too much → simplify
* Looks “cool” but empty → delete
