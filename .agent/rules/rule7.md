Excellent. This is the **last foundational lock**.
Once color + typography are fixed, *everything else becomes execution*.

Below is a **production-ready, enforceable color & typography system** you can paste into a design doc, Figma, or codebase and never debate again.

---

# 🎨 COLOR SYSTEM — LOCKED

## 🧠 COLOR PHILOSOPHY (ONE RULE)

> **Darkness is the canvas. Light is the content. Accent is permission.**

No decoration.
No vibrancy.
No visual noise.

---

## 1️⃣ BASE BACKGROUND COLORS (FOUNDATION)

These define your entire mood.

### Primary Background (Default)

```
Ink Blue / Midnight Graphite
HEX: #0B0F14
```

* Used for: body, hero, most sections
* Never use pure black

### Secondary Background (Layering)

```
Warm Charcoal
HEX: #121821
```

* Used for: section separation, depth layers
* Difference must be felt, not seen

🚫 Never introduce a third background color.

---

## 2️⃣ TEXT COLORS (HIERARCHY)

### Primary Text (Headings)

```
Soft Off-White
HEX: #E6E9EE
```

* Never pure white
* Used only for headings & key statements

### Secondary Text (Body)

```
Muted Gray-Blue
HEX: #A7B0C0
```

* Comfortable reading
* Feels intellectual, not loud

### Tertiary Text (Meta / Labels)

```
Cool Neutral Gray
HEX: #7C8798
```

* Used for captions, dates, footnotes

🚫 Never exceed 3 text colors.

---

## 3️⃣ ACCENT COLOR (CHOOSE ONE — LOCK IT)

You are allowed **exactly one accent color** across the entire site.

### Recommended for *you*:

```
Muted Cyan (Intelligence & Clarity)
HEX: #6FAECF
```

Alternate (only if you strongly feel it):

* Pale Amber → warmth
* Soft Violet → research abstraction

### Accent usage rules:

* Never for body text
* Never full backgrounds
* Only for:

  * Small highlights
  * Focus states
  * Thin dividers
  * Micro glows

> Accent is **whispered**, not spoken.

---

## 4️⃣ COLOR USAGE RATIOS (CRITICAL)

Enforce this ratio strictly:

```
85% Dark backgrounds
10% Text
5% Accent (MAX)
```

If accent feels noticeable → you overused it.

---

## 5️⃣ GRADIENTS (VERY RESTRICTED)

Allowed:

* Single-direction
* Same hue family
* Very low contrast

Example:

```
#0B0F14 → #121821
```

🚫 No multicolor gradients
🚫 No radial neon effects

Gradients should feel like **light falloff**, not color blending.

---

# ✍️ TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM — LOCKED

## 🧠 TYPOGRAPHY PHILOSOPHY

> **Typography should feel like thinking — not marketing.**

Readable.
Quiet.
Confident.

---

## 1️⃣ FONT STACK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Primary Typeface (Everything)

```
Inter
```

Why Inter:

* Neutral
* Research-friendly
* Apple-adjacent
* Excellent at large sizes

🚫 Do NOT mix typefaces
🚫 Do NOT add display fonts

One font = confidence.

---

## 2️⃣ FONT WEIGHTS (STRICT SET)

You are allowed **only these weights**:

| Weight | Use                     |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| 300    | Large hero statements   |
| 400    | Body text               |
| 500    | Emphasis / UI labels    |
| 600    | Section headings (rare) |

🚫 Never use 700+
🚫 Never use italics

---

## 3️⃣ TYPE SCALE (LOCKED)

### Desktop

| Role  | Size    | Line Height |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| Hero  | 64–72px | 1.1         |
| H1    | 48px    | 1.15        |
| H2    | 32px    | 1.25        |
| Body  | 16–18px | 1.7         |
| Small | 13–14px | 1.6         |

### Mobile

* Reduce sizes by ~20%
* Maintain line-height ratios

---

## 4️⃣ LETTER SPACING (IMPORTANT DETAIL)

### Headings

```
letter-spacing: 0.02em
```

* Gives calm, cinematic feel

### Body

```
letter-spacing: normal
```

🚫 Never tighten body text
🚫 Never over-track small text

---

## 5️⃣ TEXT ALIGNMENT RULES

* Headings: left or center (never mixed per section)
* Body: left aligned only
* No justified text

Whitespace is part of the typography.

---

## 6️⃣ TEXT ANIMATION RULES (COLOR + TYPE)

When text animates:

* Color never changes
* Weight never changes
* Only:

  * Opacity
  * TranslateY (≤12px)

Typography should not *perform*.

---

## 7️⃣ CODE / TECH TEXT (IF ANY)

If you show code snippets (sparingly):

* Same font (Inter)
* Slightly smaller
* Subtle background tint (`#121821`)
* No monospace unless unavoidable

This reinforces **systems thinking**, not hacker aesthetic.

---

# 🔒 FINAL COLOR & TYPOGRAPHY LOCK (SAVE THIS)

> **A dark, restrained color system where light reveals meaning — paired with a single, neutral typeface used with discipline and confidence.**

If something feels:

* Stylish → simplify
* Trendy → remove
* Decorative → delete
