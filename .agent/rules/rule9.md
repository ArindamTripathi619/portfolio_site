Perfect. Below are **exact, copy-paste Gemini prompts**, written so that **every generated asset stays inside the locked mood, color, motion, and typography system** you’ve defined.

These are **production prompts**, not inspirational ones.

I’ll organize them **section by section**, with:

* Purpose
* Prompt (ready to paste)
* What you’re allowed to tweak
* Output expectations

---

# 🧠 GLOBAL PROMPT RULE (READ ONCE)

**Always keep this invariant block** in *every* prompt:

```
Style: cinematic, restrained, Apple product reveal aesthetic
Mood: quiet, intellectual, introspective
Lighting: soft, directional, volumetric light with gentle falloff
Color palette: dark blue-black background, muted highlights, no bright colors
Motion: slow emergence, gentle drift, no sudden movement
Texture: subtle film grain, barely visible
Restrictions: no text, no symbols, no logos, no UI elements, no people
```

Only the **metaphor + motion emphasis** changes per asset.

# SECTION 0 — HERO (Identity)

## 🎬 Asset: Hero Cinematic Loop

**Purpose:**
Set emotional tone before any text appears.

### ✅ PROMPT (Hero)

```
Create cinematic abstract motion frames for a premium technology portfolio.

Abstract smooth planes and volumes subtly shift in depth.
Light feels intelligent and intentional, not decorative.

Style: cinematic, restrained, Apple product reveal aesthetic
Mood: quiet, confident, introspective
Lighting: single soft volumetric light source, gentle bloom on highlights
Color palette: dark ink blue background with muted silver-blue highlights

Camera:
Centered composition, slight parallax depth, no sharp angles.

Output:
Frame sequence suitable for a 6–8 second seamless loop.
```

**Do NOT change:**

* Lighting description
* Color palette

**Allowed tweak:**

* Shape density (more / less abstract)

## 🎬 Asset: Domain Micro-Visuals (×3–4)

Use **same base prompt**, change only *Scene description*.

### AI / Intelligence Variant

```
Scene description:
Soft flowing light paths slowly forming and dissolving,
suggesting intelligence emerging without force.
```

### Mobile / Experience Variant

```
Scene description:

# 🔐 FINAL EXECUTION RULE

If you ever feel tempted to add:

* Text into visuals
* Literal metaphors
* Extra colors
* Faster motion

**Stop.**
The restraint *is* the differentiation.
